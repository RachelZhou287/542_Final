# Overview

- `comparision experiment`: Model training, the logistics of ResNet and Standard CNN in comparision experiment is the same as the training logistics as Bilinear CNN under folder `Bilinear_CNN`
- `ResNet`,`Baseline CNN`: Model building

# 2 Algorithms

* Bilinear CNN
* ResNet


# 2 Datasets

* Caltech Bird (CUB) -- 3 stage fine tuning, under folder `comparision experiment`
* MNIST_FASHION -- fixed lr, under folder `comparision experiment`









# Responsibility:

* Christina Chen:ResNet
* Quinn Nguyen: Baseline CNN
* Yichen Zhou: Bilinear CNN & Comparision Experient
